# Cryptocurrencies

## Brief Overview
In this analysis, I was tasked to investigate cryptocurrencies on the trading market and classify them into groups using unsupervised machine learning. To achieve this, I had to preprocess the data, then reduce data dimensions using PCA algorithm, then cluster the cryptocurrencies using K-means algorithm, and finally visualize the results.
